\begin{abstract}
I am indebted to several people who have helped me out during the course of my master's thesis, which in many ways was among my first attempts at doing real research. Writing the acknowledgement section is generally left to the back-end of the thesis, but I figured I'd thank people I should be thanking while I still remembered who I should be thanking; so here goes.\\

To my classmates, with whom, by pure chance, I had the greatest opportunity to study, work, interact during my free time in the lab (which was most of the time anyway), and become good friends - Stijn (pronounced [st$\epsilon$:n] or [st$\epsilon$in], for the uninitiated), Diego, Roald, Ruben, Niki, and Aregawi - a big thank you is in order. The coffee and lunch breaks will not be forgotten, nor will the weekend parties. Stijn and Roald, thank you for introducing me to everything Belgian (or Flemish); I'm sure I know more about Belgium than an average immigrant living there, thanks to you! Too bad RCB didn't qualify for the playoffs this IPL Stijn, Kohli the merciful gave it all away.\\

Whether or not you taught me any useful Spanish - Diego, Ruben, and Angelica, you've taught me enough to ask for directions to the nearest Taco shop, the library, or how to ask for water, and thank someone when they do! If you ever read a news article about an Indian guy who spoke hilarious Spanish while he was in Spain, you'll know who it is.\\

To my other friends and acquaintances in the lab: Ahmed, Angelica, Cristina, Schaninez, Matteo, Ioana, and several others whose names would take up this entire page, I would like to thank you all profusely as well. Time spent with you guys was time well spent!\\

To my professors - past and present, to my supervisors Rapha{\"e}l and Vincent, and to Marie-C{\'e}cile, I am forever in your debt for your guidance - both professional and personal - and for your constant encouragement. I would like to thank Gabriel Hjort Blinder for his preamble to the \textit{memoir} package in \LaTeX , based on which this document has been typeset.\\

To my parents, who stood by me through thick and thin, and who later kept sending me money when I moved to France, despite the depreciating value of the Indian Rupee, I have yet to find a word in any English dictionary that will sufficiently express my gratitude.\\

Last but not the least, I would like to thank the Oxford comma, the repeated and generous use of which not only removes any ambiguity in this document, but also makes it look scholarly, and the progressive discontinuation of which causes me great pain. If I wasn't doing what I'm doing now, I'd be out on the streets protesting against the discontinuation of this much-needed punctuation mark.\\
